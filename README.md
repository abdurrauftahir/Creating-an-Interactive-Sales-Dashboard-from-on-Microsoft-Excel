Create an Interactive Sales Dashboard from Scratch on Microsoft Excel
Dataset for the Dashboard
In this project, I am working with hypothetical sales data for a hypothetical company. The dataset includes the following columns: "Order Date", "Year", "Month",  "Customer Name",  "State",  "Category", "Sub-Category", "Product Name", "Sales"  "Quantity", "Profit". Here is the snapshot of the data:

Planning the Dashboard
Before creating any dashboard, one must plan out the whole approach. Every dataset and every dashboard has its unique approach. In this project, I used the given sales data to create a sales dashboard.

So let me take a look at the data first, I must figure out all the important key metrics that I must include in the dashboard so that it provides clear and informative insights into the data and helps in forecasting & decision making.

As I am working on the sales dashboard, my focus should be on the sales and every metric correlated to it. Here is the list of all the charts we will be including in the dashboard:

Here you must observe that every chart has its purpose, and gives useful insight to the company to track the sales for the company. A good amount of research must be done before finalizing the charts for the dashboard, as these charts reflect the performance of the company. So, all the charts must be informative, and minimal, and they should justify the data they are reflecting.
Here is the preview of what you will be able to build at the end of this project:

Creating Visualizations
Now i prepared PivotTables. A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. You can use a Pivot Table to analyze numerical data in detail and answer unanticipated questions about your data. A PivotTable is specially designed for Querying large amounts of data in many user-friendly ways.
I created my whole Dashboard using PivotTables.
To create a PivotTable, follow the given steps:

Select any cell in the data or also select the whole data using the ctrl+A.
In the ribbon go to Insert, select PivotTable.
In the PivotTable pop-up window do not change anything and click OK.

Conclusion
In this article, I have explained how to create an interactive sales dashboard from scratch on MS Excel (without VBA). I discussed how to plan the dashboard, create tables and pivot tables, create and customize visualizations/charts, create the layout of the dashboard, how to bring all charts together on the dashboard, make the charts beautiful and how to connect all these charts to common slicers and timelines.
